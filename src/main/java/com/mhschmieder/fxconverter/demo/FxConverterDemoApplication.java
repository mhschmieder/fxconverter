/**
 * {@code FxConverterDemoApplication} is an example of a JavaFX-based
 * application that can export to vector graphics.
 * <p>
 * All that is needed, is a menu system and file chooser, plus a custom dialog,
 * to query the title and File Name. Almost any existing JavaFX application will
 * already have this support.
 * <p>
 * A sample stage is supplied as an example of the minimal code needed when not
 * starting from scratch.
 * <p>
 * This code is provided only as a example for adding this functionality to your
 * own application, and is not meant to serve as a mini-application for
 * converting GUI visuals to vector graphics; nor has it been tested fully. It
 * is the maximal subset of non-proprietary code in the author's commercial
 * application that could be safely extracted for public consumption.
 * <p>
 * Once I have written my boilerplate library for JavaFX GUI's, I will re-do
 * this demo app to take advantage of that library and improve the layout and
 * other aspects as this was a hastily written bare bones demo just to prove the
 * basic concepts of the converter libraries.
