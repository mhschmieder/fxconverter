# FxConverter

The FxConverter library is a toolkit for converting JavaFX based graphics and GUI elements to various vector graphics output formats such as EPS, SVG and PDF, via intermediary transcoding to AWT using the excellent JFXConverter library by Hervé Girod, which allows one to connect legacy AWT-based Java libraries to JavaFX application elements.

ALERT: Please note that there seem to have been some recent changes to the artifact labeling of several of the legacy Java 8 versions of JFreeOrg's libraries, but I won't have time to update my POM's and/or API calls in this library for at least a few days (as of early October 20201, when I discovered the new discrepancy).

Although the JFXConverter library has its own drivers and extensions for the supported file formats, I needed to switch to better libraries for each vector graphics target and to have this code all available in a coordinated release with my other libraries. It is possible that this library may go away later on if Hervé likewise switches his source libraries for EPS and SVG (the latter currently uses Batik, which is very old and hard to maintain integration compatibility) and adds PDF support (this is my most important output format overall, and is meant to eventually supplant the need for EPS).

Eclipse and NetBeans related support files are included as they are generic and are agnostic to the OS or to the user's system details and file system structure, so it seems helpful to post them in order to accelerate the integration of this library into a user's normal IDE project workflow and build cycle.

The Javadocs are 100% compliant and complete, but I am still learning how to publish those at the hosting site that I think is part of Maven Central, as it is a bad idea to bloat a GitHub project with such files and to complicate repository changes (just as with binary files and archices). Hopefully later tonight!

This projects depends on my GraphicsToolkit and EpsToolkit libraries, as well as depending on Object Refinery's JFreeSVG and JFreePDF libraries, along with the JFXConverter library, and is marked as such in the Maven POM file.

Please note that for now my forks must be used for both external dependencies, as I had to modify the POM in order to specify Java 1.8 vs. Java 11.

This is a placeholder note: this library does not build yet, due to JFXConverter not being found. It is not yet a GitHub project or available as an artifact at Maven Central, so I think I will migrate it to Maven myself and bump its rev to 0.24 to avoid confusion. It has a run-time dependency though as well, and that one isn't open source, so it's another learningt curve for me, to see how to package pre-built resources that aren't yet using the GitHub + Maven paradigm.

UPDATE: Although I just now found a recent GitHub posting of this library, with Maven build support, I don't have mnuch time available to work on complex integrations and I ran into issues so I will see if we can combine forces later but for now I borrowed the approach I used to resolve Qoppa's jPDFWriter dependencies, and I think I got it down to three M2 Cache directories that you need to create and populate weith direct downloads from the SourceForge site for JFXConverter, using the latest 0.24 build.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfxconverter/files/Version%200.24/

As contributed to JFXConverter around the v0.17 through v0.19 release cycle, I have enough familiarity with how it breaks down that I was able to make decisions that only took a couple of hours to fully resolve into a successful build, the final step of which was to disable Javadoc errors in JFXConverter from blocking builds of my toolkit.

You'll need to make fake M2 caches for three JAR's that are found after unzipping the binary JAR in the list linked above. One for org/jfxconverter/jfxconverter/0.24, one for com/mdiutil/mdiutilities-core/0.24, and one for com/mdiutil/mdiutilities-ui/0.24. Then copy the respective JAR's one-by one into their matched cache directories, and rename them to match proper naming conventions for Maven references in the POM file of my prokect: jfxconverter-0.24.jar, mdiutilities-core-0.24.jar, and mdiutilities-ui-0.24.jar.

I do not yet know if run-time dependencies will be missing, as I don't have time right now to resol,ve unrelated build issues with an app I wrote that uses this library. I think the main JFXConverter JAR is a superjar though. If it isn't, it needs Apache Batik ands a few others, some of them likely already present from other library dependencies as Apache Commons (for instance) is widely used. Nevertheless, I had to be careful about versions on stuff like Apache POI due to API compatibility issues.

The other thing I have not done yet, is ensure that my modified, enhanvced, and improved drivers (which also cover additional formats) get used vs. the older ones built into the JFXConverter itself. Although I think those are still packaged as separate JAR's so that people who don't need PowerPoint support don't have to pull in PPT stuff.
